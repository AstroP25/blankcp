# Blank Radio Codeplug Repository

This project is aimed at providing a blank codeplug repository for two way radio systems. While this is really aimed at providing blank codeplugs for Motorola radios, it can really be used for any radio vendor.

Naming Convention
Codeplugs in this repository are structured as follows...
<Model_Number>_<flashcode>.file

With some cases, such as with MotoTRBO radios, flashcode does not apply. Full numbers should be utilzied and not the model number stated on the front of the radio.

As an example, the codeplug of a VHF Motorola XTS1500 with model number of H46KDD9PW5BN and a flashcode of 500008-000488-2 would be named:
H46KDD9PW5BN_500008-000488-2.cpg

The initial commit of this project mainly has Motorola APX blank codeplugs taken from new Motorola radios as the default codeplug that shipped with them. Assume all codeplugs use the latest version of avaialbe CPS unless otherwise noted.

The following list provides most recent codeplug versions used.
Motorola APX ver: CPS R24.00.00
Motorola Astro 25 ver: CPS R20.01.00
Motorola TRBO ver: CPS 16.0

This repository is freely distributed and will continue to be added to and grown.
